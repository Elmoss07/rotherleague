            <div class="col-md-8 col-md-offset-2 lead">1. Any act, statement, conduct or other matter which harms a child or children, or poses or may &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; pose a risk of harm to a child or children, shall constitute behaviour which is improper and &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; brings the game into disrepute.<p><br></p><p>2. (A) In these Regulations the expression "Offence" shall mean any one or more of the offences &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; contained in the Schedules of the Criminal Justice and Court Services Act 2000, and any &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; other criminal offence which reasonably causes The Football Association to believe that the &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; person accused of the offence poses or may pose a risk of harm to a child or children.</p><p><span style="font-size: 1.25rem;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (B) All persons in such positions that the Football Association deems relevant whose normal &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;duties include caring for, training, supervising or being in sole charge of children are &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;required to obtain an Enhanced Disclosure via the Association’s CRC process.</span><br></p><p><br></p><p>3. Upon receipt by The Football Association of:</p><p><span style="font-size: 1.25rem;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;1. &nbsp; 3.1  notification that an individual has been charged with an Offence; or<br></span><span style="font-size: 1.25rem;"><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;2. &nbsp;3.2  notification that an individual is the subject of an investigation by the Police, Social &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Services or any other authority relating to an Offence; or</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 1.25rem;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;3. &nbsp;3.3  any other information which causes The Football Association reasonably to believe &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;that a person poses or may pose a risk of harm to a child or children, then The Football &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Association shall have the power to order that the individual be suspended from all or any &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;specific football activity for such period and on such terms and conditions as it thinks fit.</span><br></p><p><span style="font-size: 1.25rem;">4. In reaching its determination as to whether an order under Regulation 3 should be made The &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Football Association shall give consideration, inter alia, to the following factors:</span><br></p><p><span style="font-size: 1.25rem;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 1. &nbsp;4.1  whether a child is or children are or may be at risk of harm;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 1.25rem;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 2. &nbsp;4.2  whether the matters are of a serious nature;<br></span><span style="font-size: 1.25rem;"><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 3 . 4.3  whether an order is necessary or desirable to allow the conduct of any investigation by &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1.25rem;">The Football Association or any other authority or body to proceed unimpeded.<br><br>5. The period of an order referred to in 3 above shall not be capable of lasting beyond the date &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;upon which any charge under the Rules of The Football Association or any Offence is decided &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;or brought to an end.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 1.25rem;">6. Where an order is imposed on an individual under regulation 3 above, The Football &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Association shall bring and conclude any proceedings under the Rules of The Football &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Association against the person relating to the matters as soon as reasonably practicable.</span><br></p><p><span style="font-size: 1.25rem;">7. Where a person is convicted, or is made the subject of a caution in respect of an Offence, that &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;shall constitute a breach of the Rules of The Football Association and The Football &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Association shall have the power to order the suspension of the person from all or any &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;specific football activity for such a period (including indefinitely), and on such terms and &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;conditions as it thinks fit.</span><br></p><p><span style="font-size: 1.25rem;">8. For the purposes of these Regulations, The Football Association shall act through its Council &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;or any committee or sub-committee thereof, including the Board.</span><br></p><p><span style="font-size: 1.25rem;">9. Notification in writing of an order referred to above shall be given to the person concerned &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;and/or any Club with which he is associated as soon as reasonably practicable.</span><br></p><p><span style="font-size: 1.25rem;">10. The applicable standard of proof shall be the civil standard, of the balance of prob ability. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The more serious the allegation, taking into account the nature of the misconduct alleged &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and the context of the case, the greater the burden of evidence required to find the matter &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; proved. Save that for charges pursuant to The Football Association’s Safeguarding Children &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; policy, where the welfare and protection of the children shall be paramount and the test &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; shall be whether more likely than not.</span><br></p></div>
